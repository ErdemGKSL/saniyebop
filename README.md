# Saniyebop
Saniyebop is a fork of [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop) and [Equibop](https://github.com/Equicord/Equibop).

You probably shouldnt use this, we are doing this for Saniye Staff Only.

**Main features**:
- Equicord preinstalled
- Much more lightweight and faster than the official Discord app
- Linux Screenshare with sound & wayland
- Much better privacy, since Discord has no access to your system

**Extra included changes**

- Tray Customization with voice detection and notification badges
- Command-line flags to toggle microphone and deafen status (Linux)
- Custom Arguments from [this PR](https://github.com/Equicord/Equibop/pull/46)
- arRPC-bun with debug logging support https://github.com/Creationsss/arrpc-bun


## Building from Source

You need to have the following dependencies installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)

Packaging will create builds in the dist/ folder

```sh
git clone https://github.com/byigitt/saniyebop
cd saniyebop

# Install Dependencies
bun install

# Either run it without packaging
bun start

# Or package (will build packages for your OS)
bun package

# Or only build the Linux Pacman package
bun package --linux pacman

# Or package to a directory only
bun package:dir
```

## Building LibVesktop from Source

This is a small C++ helper library saniyebop uses on Linux to emit D-Bus events. By default, prebuilt binaries for x64 and arm64 are used.

If you want to build it from source:
1. Install build dependencies:
    - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install build-essential python3 curl pkg-config libglib2.0-dev`
    - Fedora: `dnf install @c-development @development-tools python3 curl pkgconf-pkg-config glib2-devel`
2. Run `bun buildLibVesktop`
3. From now on, building saniyebop will use your own build
